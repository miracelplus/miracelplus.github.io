I'm Haowei Sun, a PhD student in the [Department of Civil Engineering](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/) at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Henry Liu](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/people/liu-henry/). I am also a member of the [Michigan Traffic Lab](https://traffic.engin.umich.edu/).

My research interests lie in the safety evaluation of autonomous vehicles and the "curse of rarity" in autonomous driving. I am also interested in the application of machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning in transportation engineering.
